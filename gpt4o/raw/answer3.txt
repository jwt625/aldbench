Growing zinc oxide (ZnO) epitaxially on sapphire using atomic layer deposition (ALD) requires careful control of several parameters to ensure high-quality film growth. Here are some general guidelines and conditions you might consider:

1. **Substrate Preparation:**
   - Use c-plane sapphire (Al₂O₃) as it is commonly used for epitaxial growth of ZnO.
   - Clean the substrate thoroughly to remove any contaminants. This can involve solvent cleaning followed by annealing in air or oxygen to ensure a clean and ordered surface.

2. **Precursor Selection:**
   - Common precursors for ZnO ALD include diethylzinc (DEZ) or zinc acetate for the zinc source, and water (H₂O) or ozone (O₃) for the oxygen source.
   - Ensure high purity of precursors to minimize contamination.

3. **Deposition Temperature:**
   - The deposition temperature is critical for epitaxial growth. Typically, temperatures range from 150°C to 250°C.
   - Higher temperatures can improve crystallinity but may also increase the risk of precursor decomposition.

4. **Pulse and Purge Times:**
   - Optimize the pulse and purge times for both precursors to ensure complete reaction and removal of excess precursors and by-products.
   - Typical pulse times might be in the range of 0.1 to 1 second, with purge times of 5 to 20 seconds, but these can vary depending on the specific ALD system and precursors used.

5. **Growth Rate:**
   - Monitor the growth rate, which is typically around 1-2 Å per cycle for ZnO ALD.
   - Consistent growth rates indicate stable process conditions.

6. **Pressure:**
   - Maintain a low-pressure environment, typically in the range of a few millitorr to a few hundred millitorr, to facilitate precursor adsorption and reaction.

7. **Post-Deposition Annealing:**
   - Consider post-deposition annealing in an oxygen atmosphere to improve crystallinity and reduce defects.
   - Annealing temperatures can range from 400°C to 800°C, depending on the desired film properties.

8. **Characterization:**
   - Use techniques like X-ray diffraction (XRD) to assess the epitaxial quality and crystallinity of the ZnO film.
   - Additional characterization methods such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM) or atomic force microscopy (AFM) can provide information on surface morphology.

These conditions are general guidelines and may need to be adjusted based on specific equipment, precursor chemistry, and desired film properties. It's often beneficial to conduct a series of experiments to optimize the conditions for your specific setup.
