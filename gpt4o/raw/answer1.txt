Growing indium tin oxide (ITO) epitaxially using atomic layer deposition (ALD) without annealing is challenging. Epitaxial growth typically requires a high degree of order and crystallinity, which is often achieved through post-deposition annealing. ALD, known for its precise thickness control and conformality, usually results in amorphous or polycrystalline films at the low temperatures typically used in the process.

However, achieving epitaxial growth without annealing might be possible under specific conditions:

1. **Substrate Choice**: The substrate should have a lattice structure and orientation that closely matches ITO to promote epitaxial growth. Single-crystal substrates like sapphire or yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) might be suitable.

2. **Deposition Temperature**: Increasing the deposition temperature can enhance surface mobility, promoting crystalline growth. However, this must be balanced with the thermal stability of the substrate and the ALD precursors.

3. **Precursor Selection**: The choice of precursors can influence the growth mechanism and film quality. Using precursors that decompose at higher temperatures might help in achieving better crystallinity.

4. **Process Optimization**: Fine-tuning the ALD process parameters, such as pulse and purge times, can influence the film's microstructure.

5. **In-situ Techniques**: Utilizing in-situ techniques like plasma enhancement or laser assistance during ALD might help in achieving the desired crystallinity without the need for post-deposition annealing.

While these strategies might help, achieving high-quality epitaxial ITO films without annealing remains a complex task and may require extensive experimentation and optimization.
