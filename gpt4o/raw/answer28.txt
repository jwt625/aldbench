The temperature window for atomic layer deposition (ALD) of molybdenum disulfide (MoS₂) typically ranges from about 100°C to 450°C. However, the optimal temperature can vary depending on the specific precursors and process conditions used. Lower temperatures might be used to ensure compatibility with temperature-sensitive substrates, while higher temperatures can improve film quality and crystallinity. It's important to consult specific literature or process guidelines for the exact temperature range suitable for the precursors and equipment you are using.
