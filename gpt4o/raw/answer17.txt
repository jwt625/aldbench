Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) of iridium (Ir) typically involves the use of specific precursors and carefully controlled fabrication conditions. Here are some common precursors and conditions used for Ir ALD:

### Precursors:
1. **Iridium(III) Acetylacetonate (Ir(acac)3):**
   - This is a widely used precursor for Ir ALD due to its volatility and stability.

2. **Iridium(III) Cyclopentadienyl (IrCp) Compounds:**
   - Compounds like (methylcyclopentadienyl)iridium(I) (MeCp)Ir(COD) are also used. COD stands for 1,5-cyclooctadiene.

3. **Iridium(III) Hexafluoroacetylacetonate (Ir(hfac)3):**
   - This is another option, although less common due to potential fluorine contamination.

### Co-reactants:
- **Oxygen (O2):** Often used as a co-reactant to facilitate the formation of iridium oxide, which can then be reduced to metallic iridium.
- **Ozone (O3):** Provides a more reactive oxygen source, which can enhance the growth rate and quality of the film.
- **Hydrogen (H2):** Sometimes used in combination with oxygen to control the oxidation state and morphology of the deposited film.

### Fabrication Conditions:
1. **Temperature:**
   - The deposition temperature typically ranges from 200°C to 300°C. The exact temperature depends on the precursor and desired film properties.

2. **Pressure:**
   - ALD processes are usually conducted under low pressure, often in the range of a few millitorr to a few hundred millitorr.

3. **Pulse and Purge Times:**
   - Precise control over the precursor pulse and purge times is crucial. Typical pulse times range from 0.5 to 2 seconds, followed by purge times of 5 to 30 seconds to ensure complete removal of excess precursor and by-products.

4. **Substrate:**
   - The choice of substrate can affect the nucleation and growth of the iridium film. Common substrates include silicon, silicon dioxide, and various metal oxides.

5. **Cycle Count:**
   - The number of ALD cycles determines the thickness of the iridium film. The growth per cycle (GPC) is typically in the range of 0.1 to 0.2 nm per cycle.

These conditions can vary based on the specific equipment and desired film characteristics. It's important to optimize the process parameters for your specific application and equipment setup.
