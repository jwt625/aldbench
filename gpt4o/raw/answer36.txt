The maximum growth temperature for aluminum oxide (Al₂O₃) atomic layer deposition (ALD) using trimethylaluminum (TMA) and water (H₂O) is typically around 300-350°C. Beyond this temperature range, the thermal stability of the TMA precursor can become an issue, potentially leading to decomposition rather than the desired self-limiting surface reactions characteristic of ALD. It's important to note that the exact maximum temperature can vary depending on the specific ALD system and conditions used.
