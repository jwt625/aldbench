The growth per cycle (GPC) for atomic layer deposition (ALD) of magnesium oxide (MgO) using bis-cyclopentadienyl magnesium (Cp2Mg) and water (H2O) as precursors can vary based on specific experimental conditions, such as temperature, pulse times, and reactor design. However, at a deposition temperature of around 200Â°C, the GPC is typically in the range of approximately 0.1 to 0.2 nanometers per cycle. 

For precise values, it is recommended to refer to specific experimental studies or publications that have investigated this particular ALD process under controlled conditions.
