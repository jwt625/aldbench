Atomic layer etching (ALE) is a precise technique used to remove material at the atomic scale, often employed in semiconductor manufacturing. For copper (Cu), developing a thermal ALE process can be challenging due to copper's chemical properties and the need to avoid oxidation or unwanted reactions.

A good thermal ALE process for copper typically involves the following steps:

1. **Surface Modification**: The copper surface is first modified to form a volatile compound. This can be achieved using a halogen-containing gas, such as chlorine (Cl₂) or fluorine (F₂), which reacts with the copper surface to form copper halides (e.g., CuCl or CuF₂).

2. **Volatilization**: The modified surface layer is then removed by volatilization. This can be facilitated by introducing a second reactant gas that helps to desorb the copper halide. For example, using a ligand such as an organic molecule that can form a volatile complex with the copper halide.

3. **Purge and Repeat**: The chamber is purged to remove any remaining reactants and by-products, and the cycle is repeated to achieve the desired etch depth.

Key considerations for a successful thermal ALE process for copper include:

- **Temperature Control**: The process temperature must be carefully controlled to ensure the formation and removal of the volatile copper compound without causing unwanted reactions or damage to the underlying layers.

- **Selectivity**: The process should be selective to copper, minimizing etching of other materials present in the device structure.

- **Surface Passivation**: After etching, the copper surface may need to be passivated to prevent oxidation or contamination.

- **Process Optimization**: Parameters such as gas flow rates, exposure times, and chamber pressure need to be optimized for uniform etching and minimal roughness.

Research and development in this area are ongoing, and specific process details may vary depending on the equipment and desired application. Collaboration with equipment manufacturers and process engineers is often necessary to tailor the ALE process to specific requirements.
