Estimating the decomposition temperature of a complex organometallic compound like tricarbonyl (Î·4-2-methylene-1,3-propanediyl) ruthenium(II) can be challenging due to the lack of direct empirical data. However, several approaches can be used to make an educated estimate:

1. **Literature Review**: Search for any existing studies or reports on similar ruthenium complexes. Organometallic compounds with similar ligands or structures might have documented decomposition temperatures that can provide a reference point.

2. **Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA)**: If you have access to the compound, conducting a TGA experiment can provide direct information on its thermal stability and decomposition temperature. This technique measures the mass change of a substance as it is heated, allowing you to identify the temperature at which decomposition occurs.

3. **Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)**: Similar to TGA, DSC can be used to study the thermal behavior of the compound. It measures the heat flow associated with phase transitions, including decomposition, as a function of temperature.

4. **Computational Chemistry**: Use computational methods to model the compound and predict its thermal stability. Quantum chemical calculations, such as density functional theory (DFT), can provide insights into the energy barriers associated with decomposition pathways.

5. **Comparison with Analogous Compounds**: If data is available for similar ruthenium carbonyl complexes, you can infer the decomposition temperature based on structural similarities. Factors such as the nature of the ligands, coordination environment, and oxidation state of the metal can influence thermal stability.

6. **Empirical Rules and Correlations**: Some empirical rules or correlations might exist for estimating decomposition temperatures based on molecular structure, though these are often less reliable for complex organometallics.

7. **Consultation with Experts**: Engaging with researchers or professionals who specialize in organometallic chemistry might provide additional insights or unpublished data that could aid in estimating the decomposition temperature.

Ultimately, the most accurate estimation would come from experimental data specific to the compound in question.
