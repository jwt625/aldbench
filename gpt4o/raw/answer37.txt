When performing atomic layer deposition (ALD) of indium oxide (In2O3) using indium cyclopentadienyl (InCp) as the precursor, the temperature of the precursor bubbler is crucial for ensuring sufficient vapor pressure and consistent delivery of the precursor. Typically, the bubbler temperature for InCp is set between 70°C and 90°C. However, the exact temperature can vary depending on the specific setup and desired growth rate. It's important to ensure that the temperature is high enough to provide a stable vapor pressure but not so high that it causes decomposition of the precursor. Always refer to the manufacturer's guidelines and perform preliminary tests to optimize the conditions for your specific ALD system.
