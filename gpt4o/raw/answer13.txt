Increasing the crystallinity of atomic layer deposition (ALD) MoS2 without thermal annealing can be challenging, but there are several strategies you might consider:

1. **Precursor Selection and Optimization**: Choose high-purity precursors and optimize the ALD process parameters such as pulse and purge times, temperature, and pressure. The choice of precursors can significantly influence the quality of the deposited film.

2. **Substrate Preparation**: Ensure that the substrate is clean and has a surface that promotes the growth of crystalline MoS2. Surface treatments or the use of a seed layer might help in achieving better crystallinity.

3. **Growth Temperature**: While avoiding high-temperature annealing, you can still optimize the deposition temperature within the ALD process. Higher deposition temperatures (within the thermal stability range of the substrate and precursors) can promote better crystallinity.

4. **Layer-by-Layer Growth**: Carefully control the number of cycles and the growth per cycle to ensure a uniform and controlled layer-by-layer growth, which can enhance crystallinity.

5. **Plasma-Enhanced ALD (PEALD)**: Utilize plasma-enhanced ALD to provide additional energy to the growing film, which can help in improving crystallinity. The plasma can assist in breaking down precursors more effectively and providing energy to the surface.

6. **In-situ Doping or Alloying**: Introducing dopants or alloying elements during the ALD process might help in modifying the growth dynamics and improving crystallinity.

7. **Use of Catalysts**: Incorporating catalysts in the substrate or during the deposition process can facilitate the growth of crystalline phases.

8. **Post-Deposition Treatments**: Consider non-thermal post-deposition treatments such as laser annealing, microwave irradiation, or chemical treatments that can enhance crystallinity without high thermal budgets.

9. **Mechanical Strain**: Applying mechanical strain to the substrate during deposition might influence the growth and improve crystallinity.

10. **In-situ Monitoring and Feedback Control**: Implement real-time monitoring techniques to adjust the deposition parameters dynamically for optimal crystallinity.

Each of these strategies may require careful optimization and experimentation to achieve the desired results, as the effectiveness can vary depending on the specific ALD setup and materials involved.
