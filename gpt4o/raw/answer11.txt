The number of Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) cycles required to grow a monolayer of MoS₂ can vary based on several factors, including the specific ALD process parameters, the precursors used, and the growth conditions. However, growing a monolayer of MoS₂ typically requires a precise control over the deposition process.

In general, ALD is known for its ability to deposit materials with atomic-level precision, but the growth rate per cycle can be quite low, often less than a monolayer per cycle. For MoS₂, the growth rate might be in the range of a fraction of a monolayer per cycle, depending on the specific chemistry and conditions used.

To grow a single monolayer of MoS₂, you might need anywhere from a few cycles to several tens of cycles. It's important to optimize the process parameters, such as temperature, pulse times, and purge times, to achieve the desired growth rate and film quality.

For precise information, you would need to refer to specific studies or experiments that detail the ALD process for MoS₂ under the conditions you are considering. Additionally, consulting with the equipment manufacturer or experts in the field can provide more tailored guidance based on your specific setup and goals.
