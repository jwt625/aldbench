The out-of-plane preferential orientation of a ZnO film grown from diethyl zinc (DEZ) and water, typically using atomic layer deposition (ALD) or chemical vapor deposition (CVD), is commonly the (002) crystallographic plane. This orientation corresponds to the c-axis of the hexagonal wurtzite structure of ZnO being perpendicular to the substrate surface. The (002) orientation is often favored due to its lower surface energy and the growth kinetics involved in the deposition process.
