A hollow cathode plasma source is used in Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) to enhance the deposition process by providing a source of reactive species, typically ions and radicals, that can interact with the precursor materials. In ALD, thin films are deposited layer by layer through sequential exposure to different precursor gases. The use of a plasma source can improve the quality and properties of the deposited films by enabling more efficient surface reactions, reducing impurities, and allowing for lower deposition temperatures.

The hollow cathode design is particularly effective because it can generate a dense plasma with a high concentration of reactive species. This is achieved by confining the plasma within a hollow cathode structure, which enhances the ionization efficiency and increases the plasma density. The high-density plasma can lead to better film conformality, improved film uniformity, and enhanced film properties such as density and electrical characteristics.

In summary, a hollow cathode plasma source in ALD is used to create a reactive environment that facilitates the deposition of high-quality thin films with precise control over thickness and composition.
