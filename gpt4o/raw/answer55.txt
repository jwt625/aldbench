Reducing oxidation during the Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) process for metallic thin films is crucial for maintaining the desired properties of the film. Here are several strategies to minimize oxidation:

1. **Inert Atmosphere**: Conduct the ALD process in an inert atmosphere, such as argon or nitrogen, to prevent exposure to oxygen. This can be achieved by purging the reaction chamber with inert gases before and after each deposition cycle.

2. **Precursor Selection**: Choose metal precursors that are less prone to oxidation. Some metal precursors are more stable and less likely to oxidize during the deposition process.

3. **Reducing Agents**: Incorporate reducing agents in the ALD process. For example, using hydrogen or forming gas (a mixture of hydrogen and nitrogen) can help reduce any oxidized metal back to its metallic state.

4. **Lower Deposition Temperature**: Perform the deposition at lower temperatures to reduce the likelihood of oxidation. However, this must be balanced with the need for sufficient energy to drive the ALD reactions.

5. **Post-Deposition Treatment**: Apply post-deposition treatments such as annealing in a reducing atmosphere to remove any oxide layers that may have formed during deposition.

6. **Surface Passivation**: Use a passivation layer to protect the metal surface from oxidation. This can be a thin layer of another material that is less reactive with oxygen.

7. **Optimized Pulse and Purge Times**: Carefully optimize the pulse and purge times during the ALD process to ensure complete reaction of precursors and removal of any by-products that could lead to oxidation.

8. **Use of Plasma-Enhanced ALD (PEALD)**: In some cases, using plasma-enhanced ALD can help in reducing oxidation by providing more reactive species that can help in reducing any oxides formed.

9. **Barrier Layers**: Deposit a thin barrier layer before the metal deposition to prevent diffusion of oxygen to the metal layer.

By implementing these strategies, you can significantly reduce the oxidation of metallic thin films during the ALD process, thereby maintaining their desired properties and performance.
