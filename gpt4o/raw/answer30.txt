The nucleation delay in atomic layer deposition (ALD) of molybdenum disulfide (MoS₂) can vary depending on several factors, including the specific precursors used, the substrate material, the deposition temperature, and the process conditions. Generally, nucleation delay refers to the initial period during ALD where the growth rate is slower due to the difficulty in forming the first few layers of the material on the substrate.

For MoS₂ ALD, nucleation delays can range from a few cycles to several tens of cycles. This delay is often due to the need to form a continuous and uniform seed layer before achieving steady-state growth. Researchers have reported different nucleation delays based on their specific experimental setups and conditions. For example, using certain metal-organic precursors or optimizing the substrate surface can help reduce the nucleation delay.

To obtain precise information on nucleation delay for a specific MoS₂ ALD process, it is best to refer to experimental studies or publications that detail the conditions and results of the deposition process.
