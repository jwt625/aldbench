Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) and Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) are both techniques used for thin film deposition, but they have distinct characteristics that can help distinguish between them, even at high temperatures. Here are some key differences and methods to distinguish film formation by ALD and CVD:

1. **Deposition Mechanism:**
   - **ALD:** Involves sequential, self-limiting surface reactions. The process is characterized by alternating exposure to precursor gases, with each precursor reacting with the surface in a self-limiting manner. This results in precise control over film thickness at the atomic level.
   - **CVD:** Involves continuous exposure to precursor gases, which react on the substrate surface to form a film. The process is not self-limiting, and film growth is typically faster than ALD.

2. **Growth Rate:**
   - **ALD:** Exhibits a linear growth rate with respect to the number of cycles, typically in the range of angstroms per cycle. The growth rate is independent of precursor concentration once saturation is reached.
   - **CVD:** Growth rate is generally higher and depends on factors like temperature, pressure, and precursor concentration.

3. **Film Uniformity and Conformality:**
   - **ALD:** Provides excellent uniformity and conformality, even on complex 3D structures, due to the self-limiting nature of the reactions.
   - **CVD:** While capable of good uniformity, it may struggle with conformality on high aspect ratio structures compared to ALD.

4. **Temperature Sensitivity:**
   - **ALD:** Can be performed at a range of temperatures, but high temperatures may affect the self-limiting nature if they cause precursor decomposition.
   - **CVD:** Typically requires higher temperatures to drive the chemical reactions, which can lead to different film properties compared to ALD.

5. **Analytical Techniques:**
   - **Ellipsometry or X-ray Reflectivity (XRR):** Can be used to measure film thickness and growth rates. ALD will show a linear increase in thickness per cycle, while CVD will show a continuous increase over time.
   - **Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) or Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM):** Can be used to examine film conformality and uniformity.
   - **X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) or Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS):** Can provide information on film composition and uniformity.

6. **Surface Sensitivity:**
   - **ALD:** Highly surface-sensitive due to the self-limiting reactions, which can be confirmed by observing the saturation behavior in growth per cycle.
   - **CVD:** Less surface-sensitive, with growth rates more dependent on gas-phase reactions.

By analyzing these characteristics and employing appropriate analytical techniques, one can distinguish between films formed by ALD and CVD, even at high temperatures.
