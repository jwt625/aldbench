The growth per cycle (GPC) of molybdenum disulfide (MoS₂) using atomic layer deposition (ALD) can vary depending on the specific precursors, process conditions, and equipment used. However, typical GPC values for MoS₂ ALD are often in the range of 0.6 to 1.0 Å per cycle. It's important to note that these values can fluctuate based on factors such as temperature, precursor chemistry, and the specific ALD process parameters employed. For precise values, consulting specific experimental studies or manufacturer data for the ALD system in use would be necessary.
