A major source of signal instability when performing in situ Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM) measurements during Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) is temperature fluctuations. Temperature changes can affect the frequency of the quartz crystal, leading to inaccurate mass readings. This is because the QCM is highly sensitive to temperature variations, which can cause thermal expansion or contraction of the crystal, altering its resonant frequency independently of mass changes. Additionally, other factors such as pressure variations, gas flow turbulence, and contamination of the crystal surface can also contribute to signal instability. Ensuring a stable temperature environment and minimizing other external disturbances are crucial for obtaining accurate and reliable QCM measurements during ALD processes.
