In plasma-assisted atomic layer deposition (ALD), several plasma parameters can be controlled to influence the deposition process and the properties of the resulting thin films. Key plasma parameters include:

1. **Plasma Power**: The power level of the plasma can affect the density and energy of the ions and radicals generated. Higher power typically increases the reactivity of the plasma species.

2. **Plasma Frequency**: The frequency of the RF (radio frequency) power source can influence the plasma characteristics. Common frequencies are 13.56 MHz or 2.45 GHz (microwave).

3. **Gas Flow Rates**: The flow rates of the precursor gases and the plasma-forming gases (such as argon, oxygen, nitrogen, or hydrogen) can be adjusted to control the composition and pressure of the plasma.

4. **Pressure**: The pressure within the ALD chamber can be controlled to influence the mean free path of the plasma species and the overall plasma density.

5. **Plasma Exposure Time**: The duration for which the substrate is exposed to the plasma can be varied to control the extent of surface reactions and film growth per cycle.

6. **Substrate Temperature**: Although not a direct plasma parameter, the substrate temperature can influence the interaction between the plasma species and the surface, affecting film growth and properties.

7. **Plasma Composition**: By varying the types and ratios of gases used to generate the plasma, the composition of reactive species can be tailored to achieve specific film properties.

8. **Plasma Density**: This refers to the concentration of charged particles in the plasma. It can be influenced by power, pressure, and gas flow rates.

9. **Bias Voltage**: Applying a bias voltage to the substrate can control the energy of ions impacting the surface, which can affect film density and stress.

10. **Distance Between Plasma Source and Substrate**: The distance can affect the energy and density of the plasma species reaching the substrate.

By carefully controlling these parameters, researchers and engineers can optimize the ALD process for specific materials and applications, achieving desired film thickness, uniformity, composition, and other properties.
