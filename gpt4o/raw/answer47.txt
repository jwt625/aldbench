Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) is a thin-film deposition technique that allows for the precise control of film thickness and composition at the atomic level. It is widely used in various industries, including electronics, energy, and materials science. A wide range of materials can be synthesized using ALD, including:

1. **Oxides**: 
   - Aluminum oxide (Al₂O₃)
   - Titanium dioxide (TiO₂)
   - Zinc oxide (ZnO)
   - Hafnium oxide (HfO₂)
   - Silicon dioxide (SiO₂)

2. **Nitrides**:
   - Aluminum nitride (AlN)
   - Titanium nitride (TiN)
   - Silicon nitride (Si₃N₄)

3. **Sulfides**:
   - Zinc sulfide (ZnS)
   - Cadmium sulfide (CdS)

4. **Metals**:
   - Platinum (Pt)
   - Palladium (Pd)
   - Ruthenium (Ru)
   - Copper (Cu)

5. **Phosphides**:
   - Gallium phosphide (GaP)
   - Indium phosphide (InP)

6. **Fluorides**:
   - Magnesium fluoride (MgF₂)
   - Calcium fluoride (CaF₂)

7. **Chalcogenides**:
   - Molybdenum disulfide (MoS₂)
   - Tungsten disulfide (WS₂)

8. **Complex Oxides**:
   - Barium strontium titanate (BST)
   - Lanthanum strontium manganite (LSMO)

9. **Organic-Inorganic Hybrid Materials**:
   - Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)
   - Hybrid perovskites

The versatility of ALD in depositing a wide variety of materials is due to its ability to use different precursors and reactants, allowing for the synthesis of both simple and complex compounds. This makes ALD a powerful tool for applications requiring precise control over film properties, such as in semiconductor manufacturing, catalysis, and the development of advanced materials.
