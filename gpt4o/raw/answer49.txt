Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) is a thin-film deposition technique that typically operates within a temperature window of approximately 100°C to 300°C. However, the exact temperature range can vary depending on the specific materials and precursors used in the process. Some ALD processes may occur at temperatures as low as room temperature or as high as 500°C or more, depending on the thermal stability of the precursors and the desired film properties. The chosen temperature must be high enough to ensure sufficient precursor reactivity and surface saturation, but low enough to prevent thermal decomposition of the precursors or the substrate.
