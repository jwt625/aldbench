The electron mobility of MoS2 thin films prepared by atomic layer deposition (ALD) can vary depending on several factors, including the quality of the film, the substrate used, and the specific conditions of the deposition process. However, typical electron mobility values for ALD-grown MoS2 thin films are generally in the range of 0.1 to 10 cm²/V·s. It's important to note that achieving higher mobility often requires optimizing the deposition parameters and post-deposition treatments to improve the crystallinity and reduce defects in the MoS2 films.
