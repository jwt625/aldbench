Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) was invented by Dr. Tuomo Suntola and his colleague, Dr. Jorma Antson, in Finland during the 1970s. Initially, the technique was developed for the production of thin film electroluminescent displays. Dr. Suntola's pioneering work in ALD has had a significant impact on various fields, particularly in semiconductor manufacturing and nanotechnology.
